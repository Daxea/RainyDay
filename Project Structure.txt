RainyDay is comprised of three primary projects:

RainyDay					| Handles tokenization of scripts or input, and parsing those tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree.
RainyDay.Compiler			| Handles building RainyDay projects into compiled programs, probably by transpiling to (and then compiling) C#.
RainyDay.Interpreter		| Handles runtime interpretation of RainyDay AST script or input data.
